AI-Based Payload Fairing Optimization

Overview:
This project focuses on AI driven generative design and multi objective optimization of launch vehicle payload fairings. The primary objective is to minimize structural mass and cost while satisfying aerodynamic and safety constraints, enabling efficient early stage aerospace design.

A Non Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II NSGA II is used to explore the design space and generate Pareto optimal payload fairing configurations based on competing objectives.

Problem Statement:
Payload fairing design requires balancing multiple conflicting objectives including structural mass, manufacturing cost, and aerodynamic and safety constraints. Traditional design approaches are time consuming and limited in their ability to explore large design spaces. This project demonstrates how AI based optimization techniques can automate and improve the payload fairing design process.

Methodology:
The project applies NSGA II as a multi objective evolutionary optimization algorithm. Candidate payload fairing designs are evaluated using NASA inspired synthetic datasets. Pareto optimal solutions are identified to represent optimal trade offs between competing objectives. Design trends are analyzed to derive insights into structurally efficient payload fairing configurations.

Technologies Used:
Python, NSGA II genetic algorithms, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Google Colab are used for implementation and analysis.

Results:
The optimization process successfully generates Pareto fronts illustrating trade offs between structural mass and cost. Structurally efficient payload fairing designs are identified under defined constraints. The project demonstrates the applicability of AI driven optimization techniques in aerospace design problems.
